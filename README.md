Beginning PyScript
------------------

PyScript is a platform for running Python in modern web browsers.

Create apps with a PyScript development environment: write code, curate the project's assets, and test your application.

To distribute a PyScript application, host it as a static web site, then click on the link to your application. PyScript and the browser do the rest.

This page covers these core aspects of PyScript in a beginner friendly manner. We only assume you know how to use a browser and edit text.
